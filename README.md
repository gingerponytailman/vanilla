# vanilla
Vanilla is a vocal harmonizer built entirely with native MaxMSP and MIDI, inspired by <a href="">this incredible performance of "Danny Boy" by Jacob Collier</a>.

It seemed a little backwards to me at the time (and in fairness still does) that Jacob Collier gets to have proprietary harmonizer made by the MIT Media Lab, but nobody else does. That's why vanilla is open source and completely free. 

Still, it doesn't sound quite as good as the one built by MIT, which is why it's still in alpha. For that reason, please feel free to contribute!
